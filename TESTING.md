**Throughout the game development process, I relied on Google Developer Tools to experiment with different elements and phases of the game. Additionally, I leveraged the console section in Chrome Dev Tools to test JavaScript code and address any problems or glitches that occurred in the code.**

# **Automated Testing**

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website and the STYLESHEET in css file. JSHint was used to validate all my javascript files used for this project. Click on the below links to have the full validation. No error was found.

### **W3C Validator - HTML**

### **JavaScript Validator**

The code was passed through JSHint for testing, and no errors were found. Additionally, various metrics were returned, including the number of functions, the size of the largest function, and the complexity of the most complex function.

- [Js Hint validation for **contact.js**](https://jshint.com/)

  ![projectHandleData.js file](./docs/testing.md/js/testing-js-handledata.png)

- [Js Hint validation for **contact.js**](https://jshint.com/)
  ![navigation.js file](./docs/testing.md/js/testing-js-navigation.png)

- [Js Hint validation for **contact.js**](https://jshint.com/)
  ![scrollToTop.js file](./docs/testing.md/js/testing-js-scroll.png)

After validating these files, I decided to consolidate them into a single file named 'siteInteractions.js' to reduce HTTP requests and improve the web app's loading performance. This merged file now includes the functionality previously contained in 'animation.js', 'darkmode.js', 'navigation.js', and 'scrollToTop.js'.

### **Lighthouse**


Lighthouse is a tool from Google that helps you test and improve your website's performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. It provides insights and recommendations to enhance the user experience and ensure your site meets industry standards.

### **Wave**

To check the color contrast ratio between foreground and background elements, ensuring that the website is accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments. No errors or contrast error was found.
