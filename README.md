### **Imagery**

All the images displayed on this site were provided by the agency company. All rights is referenced to the company itself.

&nbsp;

### **Wireframes**

I developed the Circle Agency Project in tandem with the agency's [Figma ](https://www.figma.com/) design that was provided. The design process involved collaborating closely with the agency's team to translate their vision into a tangible digital experience. By aligning with the **Figma design** provided by the agency, I ensured consistency and fidelity throughout the development process. This approach facilitated seamless integration of design elements and functionalities, resulting in a cohesive and polished final product.

The figma wireframes for the Circle Agency Project can be viewed below:

# **Features**

### **Future-implementations**

&nbsp;

### **Accessibility**

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML elements as, header(), section(), nav().
- Declare the Language in the beginning of every html page.
- Using descriptive ALT attributes on images and links on the site.
- Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button or not.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

# **Deployment & Local Development**

### **Deploying on Netlify**

Netlify.com was used to deploy the live website. The instructions to achieve this are below:

1. **Log in (or sign up) to Netlify.com**: Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and log in to your account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to sign up for one.

2. **Connect your Git repository**: Once you're logged in, navigate to the "Sites" tab and click on the "New site from Git" button.

3. **Choose your Git provider and repository**: Select your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and choose the repository for your project.

4. **Configure your build settings**: Netlify will automatically detect your build settings, but you can customize them if needed. Make sure the build command and publish directory are correctly configured for your project.

5. **Deploy your site**: Once you've configured your build settings, click on the "Deploy site" button. Netlify will start building and deploying your site.

6. **Customize your domain (optional)**: By default, Netlify will assign a random subdomain to your site (e.g., `https://random-subdomain.netlify.app`). If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the site settings.

7. **Configure continuous deployment (optional)**: Netlify can automatically deploy updates to your site whenever you push changes to your Git repository. You can configure this in the "Build & deploy" settings.
