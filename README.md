# **Design**

&nbsp;

### **Colour Scheme**

![WebbApp Colour Palette](#image)

&nbsp;

### **Typography**

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- **Cinzel** was selected for headings and larger text elements across the site. It boasts elegant serif letterforms, lending a touch of sophistication to the design.

- **Roboto** serves as the primary typeface for body text, including paragraphs containing questions and answers. Developed by Christian Robertson, Roboto is a versatile sans-serif font known for its clean, modern appearance and excellent legibility.

### **Imagery**

All the images displayed on this site were provided by the agency and were modified by me in Photoshop or Canva.

&nbsp;

### **Wireframes**

I developed the Circle Agency Project in tandem with the agency's **Figma design**. The design process involved collaborating closely with the agency's team to translate their vision into a tangible digital experience. By aligning with the **Figma design** provided by the agency, I ensured consistency and fidelity throughout the development process. This approach facilitated seamless integration of design elements and functionalities, resulting in a cohesive and polished final product.

The website for the Circle Agency Project can be viewed here below:

# **Features**

### **Future-implementations**

&nbsp;

### **Accessibility**

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML elements as, header(), section(), nav().
- Declare the Language in the beginning of every html page.
- Using descriptive ALT attributes on images and links on the site.
- Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button or not.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
